All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Go module path is now `github.com/WhitenWhiten/topophany`.
- Contribution guidelines moved to the repository root; added security policy,
  code of conduct, issue/PR templates, Dependabot and release automation.
- Generated verification records are no longer tracked in `docs/verification/`;
  `scripts/verify.py` writes to `.verify-build/verification/` and CI uploads them
  as an artifact. `scripts/package.py` takes `--verification` to locate them.

### Fixed

- Flaky DNS TCP-fallback test fixture when the paired TCP port was already in use.

## [0.1.0]

Initial release.

- Single `topo` binary: remote TUI client, ingestion collector (`serve`) and
  scoped observation worker (`worker`).
- Native HTTP/TLS, DNS, TCP, UDP and ICMP probes; CONNECT/SOCKS5 proxy chains;
  adapters for local proxy and tunnel tooling.
- Single-writer append journal with checkpoints, crash recovery and
  deduplication; durable worker outbox.
- Evidence- and freshness-based state engine with dependency derivation.
- Terminal UI with geographic and network topology maps, offline preview
  scenarios and a local topology editor.
